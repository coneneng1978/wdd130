         <p> Warm greetings! I'm Connie Cruz Aunario from Manila, Philippines, and I'm thrilled to be diving into the world of Web Development. Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints adds an extra layer of gratitude to this exciting opportunity.

          This semester promises to be full of challenges and chances to grow, and I can't wait! Besides my love for web development, you'll often find me immersed in a good book, binge-watching K-dramas, or exploring new places. Hoping this journey not only hones my skills but also makes me more self-reliant and ready to help others. Cheers to a fantastic semester ahead! </p>
